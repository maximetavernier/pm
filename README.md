## Note ##

* You need npm to compile and run a server in dev mode.
* All the command will be done in the src directory.

## Install ##

To install all the dependencies of the project, starts by running "npm install" in a terminal.
This will install, in particular, babel that is used to compile the code, and react. Note that
the code is dev in the ES2015 syntax.

## Compile ##

To compile the code, type "npm run pm" in a terminal. This will use babel in order to compile
the code.

## Dev mode ##

To use the dev mode (start a server locally on port 8080), you need to type "npm run dev". This
will automatically compile the code, using "npm run pm" and start the server.

Then to see the web-app, you need to go on a browser, on url "localhost:8080".
